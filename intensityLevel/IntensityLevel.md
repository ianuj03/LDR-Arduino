### Components:
Name | Quantity
-----|---------
LED | 10
Breadboard | 1
Resistors (270 ohm) | 11
Jumper wire | 12 M2M
LDR | 1
Arduino Board* | 1
USB cable | 1

*Any Arduino Board will work*

### Connection:
##### LEDs:
```
Anode of LED- Connect it to the digital PIN;
Cathode of LED- Connect it to 270ohm resistor and the other end of the resistor to GND;
~Do the same for all LEDs
```
##### LDR:
```
Connect one end of the LDR to +5V;

Make a common connection for the other end,
Connect it to the ground with a 270ohm resistor and also to one of the Analog PIN.
```
